hbeanstalk
==========

About
-----

hbeanstalk is a Haskell client for the Beanstalk queue server, see <http://kr.github.com/beanstalkd/>.

Status
------

This is just being hacked on in some free minutes as I get them.  Once there is some minimal functionality, I will start to cabalize and publish an API.
